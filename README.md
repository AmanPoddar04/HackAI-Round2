# Conversational Agents with LLM Integration

This project implements a conversational system using agents. It takes user inputs, processes them through a Language Model (LLM), and provides responses through another agent. The goal is to create a responsive and intelligent interaction system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.8)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ayushawasthi24/HackAI-Round2
    ```

2. Create an .env file

    Go to https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup and generate an API key.
    Create a ```.env``` file in the src folder and write the following:
    ```
    PALM_API_KEY = "your_api_key"
    ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd HackAI-Round2
    ```
    
    

4. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    ```
    python -m venv venv_name
    venv_name\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    

### Usage

1. Run the main script:

    ```
    cd src
    python main.py
    ```
    

2. Enter your queries when prompted and observe the responses generated by the agents.


## Agents

Our application has 2 agents
1. Generator: It basically takes a user input, generates some potential responses using an LLM, feeds the query into the RAG pipeline and then sends the output to the ```Answerer``` agent.
2. Answerer: It takes the response of the generator agent and then gives it to LLM which then predicts a final response that is then shown to the user.
